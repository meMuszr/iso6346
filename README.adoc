= ISO6346 in C

== Purpose

To validate a ISO6346 compliant container number against the supplied check digit

== Intent

Free Sunday afternoon - had an interesting problem at work with a flawed check digit validator. 
After snooping around, noticed there was no fun implementation, either by way of translating letters through a key<>value map 
or utilizing `#indexOf(` . This program does the translation programatically

Another reason being that I needed a new project in C and noticed an implementation did not exist, gave me an excuse to utilize the PCRE2 lib

== Functionality

Reads from `stdin` and outputs to `stdout` if successful; otherwise, `stderr` 

== Compiling

    gcc -O3 -Wall iso6346.c -o iso6346
    gcc -O3 -Wall -lpcre2-8 iso6346_reg.c -o iso6346_reg

== TODO

* Fix the warning without sacrificing on type safety
* Refactor into library (add header)
* Package for distrubtions (deb / rpm / pkgbuild / brew formulae)
